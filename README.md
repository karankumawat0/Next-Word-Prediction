# Next-Word-Prediction
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch using NumPy to predict the next word in a given sequence. The model is trained on a small custom dataset and demonstrates key concepts like forward propagation, backpropagation through time (BPTT), and gradient descent.
